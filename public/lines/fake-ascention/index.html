&ldquo;No&hellip;It&rsquo;s &rsquo;trust&rsquo;. The commander holds the life and death of the constructors, while the state of the constructors’ M.I.N.D also constantly influences the commander.

<p>&ldquo;Do you know what forms the fundamental foundation of the Commander-Constructor tactic?&rdquo;<br>
This seems to be a tactical command lesson from a distant past, when I was called back by the teacher upon leaving the classroom. How did I answer this question back then?<br>
&ldquo;M.I.N.D Beacon.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;No&hellip;It&rsquo;s &rsquo;trust&rsquo;. The commander holds the life and death of the constructors, while the state of the constructors’ M.I.N.D also constantly influences the commander. However, because of this, the constructors must trust the commander&rsquo;s commands, and the commander needs to have trust in the combat capabilities of the constructors. When you lead your team into battle, issue combat signals, and give attack orders, the constructors wholeheartedly believe in you. They will carry out every one of your instructions. Although it may not be suitable on the battlefield, —it&rsquo;s beautiful, isn&rsquo;t it? Only absolute trust can truly bridge the gap between the commander and the constructors. It&rsquo;s such a simple truth, but many graduates&hellip; eventually forget it. Commander 08299, I hope you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?!&rdquo;<br>
Consciousness was yanked back from distant memories, and the Punishing infection rate, which should have surpassed the critical threshold, was now maintained at a safe level.<br>
&ldquo;You have the courage to link with the Ascension Network&rsquo;s agent, but do you not understand the cost?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Perhaps my consciousness will be completely corrupted.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, why are you still doing it?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Because of &rsquo;trust&rsquo;.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Trust in what?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Your longing for &lsquo;sister&rsquo;.&rdquo;<br>
Regret, pain, hatred&hellip; Amidst the chaotic torrent of consciousness flooding my mind at that moment, one emotion that, like unblemished moonlight, occupied the depths of my consciousness. It was&hellip; the purest and most intense longing.<br>
&ldquo;Lucia believes in you just like that. She believes that you&rsquo;re still her sister. Even now, she persists in her fight, seeking a way to save you. So, I don&rsquo;t want to disappoint Lucia&rsquo;s longing.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;&hellip;I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luna closed her eyes again, sensing a fresh surge of power flowing through the consciousness link.<br>
&ldquo;Power continues to be drawn out&hellip;&rdquo;<br>
The crimson Punishing virus continued to gather around Luna, and the damages to her body were gradually being repaired. Luna opened her eyes.<br>
&ldquo;&hellip;The Ascension Network indeed deemed your danger level to be very high. It&rsquo;s attempting to enhance my strength continuously to counter your M.I.N.D Beacon that resides within my mind.&rdquo;<br>
Luna extended her hand towards this side, and a faint crack appeared on it. <br>
As the link deepened, Luna&rsquo;s physical condition was transmitted through the connection. Constantly shattered&hellip; and forcibly repaired. The forces of destruction and restoration clashed within Luna&rsquo;s body. Even though the link was not yet fully established, it was already evident that her current state was insufficient to sustain her ongoing battle.</p>
<p>The surging Punishing virus was intercepted before contaminating the M.I.N.D Beacon. Luna&rsquo;s M.I.N.D deviation had reached a point where its collapse at any moment would not be surprising.<br>
Nevertheless, she spoke with utmost clarity, expressing what she desired to convey. <br>
&ldquo;If there were humans like you, perhaps this world would truly have different possibilities in the future, a path that I never imagined. Although I realize this too late now, it&hellip; it&rsquo;s enough. With this, I can unleash all the remaining power I possess to the fullest extent.&rdquo;<br>
Luna glanced at Lucia and the pure white heterozygote who were still locked in confrontation.<br>
“To these pitiful creations that appeared on this divergent path, I will bestow upon you eternal demise.”</p>
